      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest: I’ve always been impressed by people who just quickly throw together a website for a thing. Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for about seven years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done so. Recently, I acquired this domain to use with mails, had some time on my hand and decided I&amp;rsquo;d finally give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am an IT consultant based in Munich, Germany.
I finished my diploma in Mathematics with Computer Science in TU Darmstadt in 2013 and since the same year have been working with TNG Technology Consulting GmbH near Munich.
My work has largely been in large Java projects. In terms of big frameworks, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly worked with the Spring Framework, the Atlassian SDK and SAP Commerce.
My private hobbies are dancing Forró, a Brazilian couple&amp;rsquo;s dance, mainly in Munich with our local Munique Dança Forró, and boxing, where I have been a long-time member of the brilliant Boxwerk gym.</description>
